In this case, the `ens` command displays the number of notes that are cached to show you progress.

If caching is not done properly for some reason, you can use `en > clearcache` and this command to perform initial caching.

After initial caching, the cache will be updated automatically.

If you delete all the cache and use the `ens`, you are likely to be caught in the sdk's api call limit.
