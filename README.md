Alfred-evernote-workflow caches note content and resources from the Evernote client and uses them for previews.

In Preview, you can view the contents and images of your notes.


## ðŸ“Œ Prerequisite

The prerequisites below are required to use that package.

* Evernote Client on macOS (None App-store version)

* Node JS

* [Alfred powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/)

Note that your Evernote Client shouldn't be App store version. (downloaded from the App Store)

If you're not sure your Evernote Client version, I'm recommending reinstall Evernote by below version to use this plugin.

[Evernote client Download](https://evernote.com/intl/en/download)

And don't forget to login into Evernote client and sync should be completed.

##  ðŸ”¨ How to install

1. **Install package by npm**

```
$ npm install --global alfred-evernote-workflow
```

If you have problem with installation with above command,

Please refer [these installaion issues](https://github.com/jopemachine/alfred-evernote-workflow/issues/8).

And let me know if the problem still remains or if there are other issues.

If you want to install this package by not through NPM, you can download workflow file in [Packal](https://www.packal.org/workflow/alfred-evernote-workflow).

2. **`en > gettoken` + <kbd>Enter</kbd>  to get your API key**

Type `en > gettoken` and get your OAuth key.

When you log in to the site and press the authentication button, `oauthToken` is printed in json format.

Pass the value as an argument in the authtoken command.

If your token value is `S=s198:U=161532d:E=17b2ea2ba85:C=173d6f18bc8:P=185:A=jopemachine:V=2:H=2d4cbb615bb4caa3de0159c5ededeab2`, below page appears. 

(Note that this is just for giving an example. This is invalid token and you should issue your own token.)
